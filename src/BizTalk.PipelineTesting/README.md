# BizTalk Pipeline Testing Library

PipelineTesting is a library for testing BizTalk Server 2006+ pipelines and custom pipeline components
using your favorite unit testing framework (like NUnit), without having to go through the time-consuming
process of constantly redeploying to BizTalk after every change.
